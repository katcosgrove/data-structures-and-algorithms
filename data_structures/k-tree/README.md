## Data Structure: K-ary Tree

Build a k-ary tree with post-order, pre-order, and breadth-first traversals, as well as an insert method that inserts a new node as a child of a parent value.

## Challenge: Print Level Order

Write a function which takes in a k-ary tree. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return a string that contains a listing of all values in the tree, with new lines in-between each level of the tree.
