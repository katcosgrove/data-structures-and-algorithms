# Linked List Insertion
Several methods for inserting values into a linked list.

## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

.append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
.insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
.insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.
