# Linked List Insertion
Several methods for inserting values into a linked list.

## Challenge
Write the following methods for the Linked List class:

* .append(value) which adds a new node with the given value to the end of the list
* .insertBefore(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately before the first value node
* .insertAfter(value, newVal) which add a new node with the given newValue immediately after the first value node
* You have access to the Node class and all the properties on the Linked List class.
* Write a function called mergeLists which takes two linked lists as arguments. Zip the two linked lists together into one so that the nodes alternate between the two lists and return a reference to the head of the single list. Try and keep additional space down to O(1).
