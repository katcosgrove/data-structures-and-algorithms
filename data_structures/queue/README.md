# Data Structures Practice
## Queue

* Create a Class for a Queue which creates an empty Queue when instantiated
* This class should be aware of a default None value assigned to front when the isntance is created
* This class should be aware of a default None value assigned to back when the isntance is created
* This class should be aware of the len of the queue, which represents the count of Nodes in the queue at any time
* This class should have the ability to accept an iterable as an argument when instantiated, such as [1, 2, 3, 4], and creates a new Node in the queue for each value in the iterable
* Define any further magic methods such as len and str to support user functionality and informative responses
* Define a method called enqueue which takes any value as an argument and adds that value to the back of the queue with an O(1) Time performance
* Define a method called dequeue which takes no arguments and removes / returns the Node at the front of the queue
